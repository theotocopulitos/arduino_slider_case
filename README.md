arduino_slider_case
===================

Parametric Arduino Case for my camera slider project. Derived from (C) 2012 Torsten Paul &lt;Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

It is designed to include one shield, a mic connector, a LED and an IR receiver.

Printed beautifully on PLA at 70 mm/s, 195ºC and 50ºC for the bed, with fan on. Layer height of 0.4 is good enough.
